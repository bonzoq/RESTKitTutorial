## Installation

Don't forget to install pods. 

This app requires CocoaPods dependency manager. It automates and simplifies the process of using 3rd-party libraries. If you don't have it yet, you can get it by typing the following in your console:

``` sh
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

With CocoaPods up and running go to the application folder and install dependencies:

$ cd RESTKitTutorial
$ pod install
```
